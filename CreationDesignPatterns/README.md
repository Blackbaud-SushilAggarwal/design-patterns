# Creational Design Patterns (Gang of Four) - .NET 9, C# Examples

This folder contains simple, self-contained .NET 9 console apps demonstrating the five creational patterns from the Gang of Four:

- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

Run each example using the dotnet CLI. From the workspace root, for example:

```bash
dotnet run --project CreationDesignPatterns/Singleton
dotnet run --project CreationDesignPatterns/FactoryMethod
dotnet run --project CreationDesignPatterns/AbstractFactory
dotnet run --project CreationDesignPatterns/Builder
dotnet run --project CreationDesignPatterns/Prototype
```

Each project targets `net9.0` and is intentionally small for learning and experimentation.
